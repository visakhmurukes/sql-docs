# STRING_AGG (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2017-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2017-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Concatenates the values of string expressions and places separator values between them. The separator is not added at the end of string.
 
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
STRING_AGG ( expression, separator ) [ <order_clause> ]

<order_clause> ::=   
    WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY <order_by_expression_list> [ ASC | DESC ] )   
```

## Arguments 
*expression*  
Is an [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of any type. Expressions are converted to `NVARCHAR` or `VARCHAR` types during concatenation. Non-string types are converted to `NVARCHAR` type.

*separator*  
Is an [expression](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) of `NVARCHAR` or `VARCHAR` type that is used as separator for concatenated strings. It can be literal or variable. 

<order_clause>   
Optionally specify order of concatenated results using `WITHIN GROUP` clause:

```
WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY <order_by_expression_list> [ ASC | DESC ] )
```   
<order_by_expression_list>   
 
  A list of non-constant [expressions](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md) that can be used for sorting results. Only one `order_by_expression` is allowed per query. The default sort order is ascending.   
  

## Return Types 

Return type is depends on first argument (expression). If input argument is string type (`NVARCHAR`, `VARCHAR`), result type will be same as input type. The following table lists automatic conversions:  

|Input expression type |Result | 
|-------|-------|
|NVARCHAR(MAX) |NVARCHAR(MAX) |
|VARCHAR(MAX) |VARCHAR(MAX) |
|NVARCHAR(1…4000) |NVARCHAR(4000) |
|VARCHAR(1…8000) |VARCHAR(8000) |
|int, bigint, smallint, tinyint, numeric, float, real, bit, decimal, smallmoney, money, datetime, datetime2, |NVARCHAR(4000) |


## Remarks  
`STRING_AGG` is an aggregate function that takes all expressions from rows and concatenates them into a single string. Expression values are implicitly converted to string types and then concatenated. The implicit conversion to strings follows the existing rules for data type conversions. For more information about data type conversions, see [CAST and CONVERT (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql.md). 

If the input expression is type `VARCHAR`, the separator cannot be type `NVARCHAR`. 

Null values are ignored and the corresponding separator is not added. To return a place holder for null values, use the `ISNULL` function as demonstrated in example B.

`STRING_AGG` is available in any compatibility level.

A single query should not have STRING_AGG expression on the same column based on different sort order. Specifying multiple STRING_AGG calls on the same SELECT query with different sort order on the same column will result in an error like below

Multiple ordered aggregate functions in the same scope have mutually incompatible orderings

## Examples 

### A. Generate list of names separated in new lines 
The following example produces a list of names in a single result cell, separated with carriage returns.
```sql
SELECT STRING_AGG (FirstName, CHAR(13)) AS csv 
FROM Person.Person; 
```
[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|csv | 
|--- |
|Syed <br />Catherine <br />Kim <br />Kim <br />Kim <br />Hazem <br />... | 

`NULL` values found in `name` cells are not returned in result.   
> [!NOTE]  
>  If using the Management Studio Query Editor, the **Results to Grid** option cannot implement the carriage return. Switch to **Results to Text** to see the result set properly.   

### B. Generate list of names separated with comma without NULL values   
The following example replaces null values with 'N/A' and returns the names separated by commas in a single result cell.  
```sql
SELECT STRING_AGG ( ISNULL(FirstName,'N/A'), ',') AS csv 
FROM Person.Person; 
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|Csv | 
|--- |
|John,N/A,Mike,Peter,N/A,N/A,Alice,Bob |  

### C. Generate comma-separated values 
```sql   
SELECT 
STRING_AGG(CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName, ' (', ModifiedDate, ')'), CHAR(13)) 
  AS names 
FROM Person.Person; 
```
[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|names | 
|--- |
|Ken Sánchez (Feb  8 2003 12:00AM) <br />Terri Duffy (Feb 24 2002 12:00AM) <br />Roberto Tamburello (Dec  5 2001 12:00AM) <br />Rob Walters (Dec 29 2001 12:00AM) <br />... |

> [!NOTE]  
>  If using the Management Studio Query Editor, the **Results to Grid** option cannot implement the carriage return. Switch to **Results to Text** to see the result set properly.   

### D. Return news articles with related tags 
Article and their tags are separated into different tables. Developer wants to return one row per each article with all associated tags. Using following query: 
```sql
SELECT a.articleId, title, STRING_AGG (tag, ',') as tags 
FROM dbo.Article AS a       
LEFT JOIN dbo.ArticleTag AS t 
    ON a.ArticleId = t.ArticleId 
GROUP BY a.articleId, title;
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|articleId |title |tags |
|--- |--- |--- |
|172 |Polls indicate close election results |politics,polls,city council | 
|176 |New highway expected to reduce congestion |NULL |
|177 |Dogs continue to be more popular than cats |polls,animals| 

### E. Generate list of emails per towns
The following query finds the email addresses of employees and groups them by towns: 
```sql
SELECT town, STRING_AGG (email, ';') AS emails 
FROM dbo.Employee 
GROUP BY town; 
```

[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|town |emails |
|--- |--- |
|Seattle |syed0@adventure-works.com;catherine0@adventure-works.com;kim2@adventure-works.com |
|LA |sam1@adventure-works.com;hazem0@adventure-works.com |

Emails returned in the emails column can be directly used to send emails to group of people working in some particular towns. 

### F. Generate a sorted list of emails per towns   
Similar to previous example, the following query finds the email addresses of employees, groups them by town, and sorts the emails alphabetically:   
```sql
SELECT town, 
    STRING_AGG (email, ';') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY email ASC) AS emails 
FROM dbo.Employee 
GROUP BY town; 
```
   
[!INCLUDE[ssResult_md](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]

|town |emails |
|--- |--- |
|Seattle |catherine0@adventure-works.com;kim2@adventure-works.com;syed0@adventure-works.com |
|LA |hazem0@adventure-works.com;sam1@adventure-works.com |
